# linkshort-server
A simple link shortening program written in Node.js/Express

This was a fun project I did one day with my friend Josh Chapnick. This is the backend repository, as I did all the backend code. For the frontend, visit Josh's frontend repo: https://github.com/Person12123/linkshort-frontend.
